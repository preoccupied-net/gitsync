# Git Operations Rules

- Do not run `git reset`, `git revert`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, or create/delete branches; only the user performs those actions.
- `git add` and `git commit` are allowed only when the user explicitly requests them.
- Before committing, inspect the full repo diff; compose a brief summary commit message via `git commit -F - <<'EOF' ... EOF`.
- Prefer absolute paths when invoking commands.
- Run `git --no-pager status` and `git --no-pager log` to avoid pager issues.
- When renaming or deleting tracked files, use `git mv` or `git rm` so history remains coherent.
- Never modify `.plan` files or user-maintained artifacts unless told to do so.
- Surface any unexpected repo changes immediately instead of altering or discarding them.
