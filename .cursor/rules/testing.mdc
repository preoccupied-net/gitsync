# Testing Rules

- Place all automated tests under the `tests/` directory.
- Do not use typing annotations when writing unit tests.
- Author tests to reveal defects; a failing test is useful evidence and must not be muted or hidden.
- When a test fails, diagnose and summarize the issue for the user without modifying production code unless explicitly instructed.
- Never manipulate fixtures, mocks, or assertions to mask genuine failures; do not "fake green" results.
- Document observed failures clearly, including reproduction steps and suspected root cause.
- Use `tox` as the canonical entry point for running test suites and related checks.
